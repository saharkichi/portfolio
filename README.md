My motivation for this assignment was to create a portfolio for prospective employers to observe my work. I built this project to highlight my applications and web pages and to compile them into one place. 
Hopefully this portfolio will solve my current unemployment issue. I learnt how to compile factors, add images within the asset folders, add media queries, and add notes to both HTML and CSS documents. 

## Installation

Some steps to install my project was push to github and create a repository in order to deploy the webpage.
